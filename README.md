This mod is an unofficial port of [Krypton Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/krypton), designed to provide Forge &
NeoForge compatibility.

Krypton is a mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work
done in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/), [VelocityNT Recast](https://github.com/404Setup/VelocityNT-Recast)
and [Paper](https://papermc.io) projects.

Krypton derives itself from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, which means "the hidden one". This makes
it evident most of the benefit from Krypton is "hidden" but is noticeable by a server administrator.

[The wiki contains important information &ndash; read it](https://github.com/astei/krypton/wiki).

## Feature

- More basic optimizations
- Support RecastLib (Velocity Native rewritten in Rust, compatible with Windows x64/arm64)
- Support NeoForge/Forge

## About RecastLib

RecastLib is written in Rust and coexists with VelocityNative to improve performance in some scenarios.

Their benefits are obvious that both Server and Client can benefit, and that most popular PCs can run these native
libraries due to the replacement compatibility.

### RecastLib Compatibility

- Windows x64
- Windows ARM64
- Linux x64

### VelocityNative Compatibility

- Linux x64
- Linux ARM64
- MacOS ARM64

## Config

Add the following parameters to the Java startup parameters to control the mixin enablement:

| Parameter                     | Description                                  | Default value |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| krypton.loginVT               | Enable Login VirtualThread optimization      | true          |
| krypton.textFilterVT          | Enable TextFilter VirtualThread optimization | true          |
| krypton.utilVT                | Enable Util VirtualThread optimization       | true          |
| krypton.bestVarLong           | Enable VarLong optimization                  | true          |
| velocity.natives-disable      | Disable Native                               | false         |
| velocity.linux-recast-enabled | Enable RecastLib for Linux                   | false         |

example:

```shell
java -Dkrypton.loginVT=false -jar neoforge_launcher.jar
```

### Use env instead of jvm args

Some configuration items support using environment variables instead of jvm args.

| JVM ARGS                      | Environment Variable |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| velocity.linux-recast-enabled | ENABLE_LINUX_RECAST  |

## Benchmark

The Benchmark results are not necessarily accurate,
and the final results are determined based on different JVM distributions, startup parameters, and random factors.

I don't have a native Linux development environment;
all my Linux tests are done in WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which can bring about ~15%-25% additional loss.

Those tiny performance differences of about 1% can be considered as a random result.

Benchmark cannot simulate all scenarios, and the results are used only as reference.

### How to run Benchmark?

After clone KryptonFNP repo, execute `./gradlew :common:jmh` in the mod directory.
After waiting for 50â€“90 minutes, the result will be generated to `common/build/results/jmh/results.json`
